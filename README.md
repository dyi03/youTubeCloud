## Spencer Gregory and Daniel Yi

This project aims to explore an unconventional approach to cloud storage by leveraging YouTube's data center and free video upload capabilities for data storage purposes. Given YouTube's policy that allows users to upload and watch videos for free, this project seeks to investigate the potential of utilizing the video format as a medium for storing data. The core idea of this project revolves around encoding data into a video format in a manner that is similar to QR codes. Then we will explore ways of enhancing data density and retrieval efficiency.
